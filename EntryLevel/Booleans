In NL-X booleans can be used only one function at the moment. They are part of the "Write" function (as a parameter).
This is the most simlpe type of parameter/value in NL-X
#
In C++ they are typically wrote as following: bool BooleanName; 
They can usually be set to true or false
#
In NL-X, only the Write function uses booleans, and can only be set to true at the moment.
