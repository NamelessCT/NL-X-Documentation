In NL-X integer values can be used in a one place at the moment. They are part of the "Write" function (as a parameter).

Integers are just numbers, nothing too crazy to understand. 
#
In C++ integers are typically like so: int IntegerName; | They can be set to something (int IntegerName = 1;).
#
In NL-X it is used in the Write function to set the integer of a property.
