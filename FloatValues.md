In NL-X float values can be used in a few places at the moment. They are part of the "Write" function (as a parameter), ClientSpeed (as a parameter), and FOV (as a parameter).
Float values, in simple terms, are numeric values (and decimal places can be used).

An example script with a float value is

```
void Main()
{
     FOV(120.0f)
}```
