# NL-X-Documentation
**Official documentation for NL-X by NamelessCT and Xivy**
This is the documentation on how to use NL-X, the first ever Fortnite executor! Join **(discord.gg/namelessct)** for updates!

You first need NL Hybrid Premium to get access to NL-X. In the future, for higher levels, you will be required to purchase an addon for NL-X. It will most likely cost $5 extra.

The NL-X executor utilizes our custom C++ interpreter so it isn't 100% accurate to the base C++ language, especailly just at level 1.

Head over to the "ScriptCreationAndInterpretation" document to understand how to create scripts with NL-X.

Since this is starting at level 1, it won't be **perfect**, but just know we are trying our best.

For proper C++ syntax, I recommend you use an IDE such as Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code
